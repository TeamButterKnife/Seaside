Jam Garden scrum match!  Our capsule hero person must use gravity to make it to the end of the well without dying!  OH NOOOOO!  He's probably PRETTY BAD AT THAT!

## Practice Jam
This jam is a chance to practice stuff you might not get to practice if we actually cared about finishing the jam!

## GitHub Actions
This jam uses GitHub Actions and GameCI for continuous integration.  You can find the current test version of the game here: https://professorcowboy.itch.io/flappitygrav

## Current ToDo list
Get starfield working on test build
